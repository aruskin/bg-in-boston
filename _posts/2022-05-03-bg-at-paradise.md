BG's Boston show (which I assume the Larry Katz interview was connected to, although it only gets mentioned in passing at the end) took place at [Paradise Rock Club](https://musicbrainz.org/place/b9b4878f-51e0-4a19-9bae-4675b4954a8d) on 5 August 1989. How do we know this?

_The Boston Phoenix's_ issues from 1973 to 2013 are available and (crucially) searchable on the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/pub_boston-phoenix). There's a good write-up with more background on that and the role of Northeastern University Archives and Special Collections in opening up the collection on the [Internet Archive Blog](http://blog.archive.org/2021/12/15/boston-phoenix-rises-again-with-new-online-access/). I'll definitely be taking advantage of the ability to download issues and make digital clippings in this post!

Anyway, the OCR is not perfect, but you can search over the text contents of the collection and find all of the issues in which BG is mentioned. And the inconsistent romanization of Ñ‰ comes into play again here--the _Phoenix_ [primarily uses "Grebenshikov,"](https://archive.org/details/pub_boston-phoenix?query=grebenshikov&sin=TXT&sort=-date) but you'll get [one result for "Grebenshchikov"](https://archive.org/details/pub_boston-phoenix?query=grebenshchikov&sin=TXT&sort=-date): the 11 December 1987 issue has [an article about rock in the Soviet bloc](https://archive.org/details/sim_boston-phoenix_december-11-17-1987_16_50/page/n95/) from Timothy W. Ryback, discussing the scenes country by country.[^1]

We can get deeper into how BG is covered in the _Phoenix_ over time in some other post, maybe; most of the issues are from 1989, but I think the search is mostly picking up on ads and chart placements for _Radio Silence_ and not more extensive coverage. The issue of interest here is from [4 August 1989 (Vol. 18, Iss. 31)](https://archive.org/details/sim_boston-phoenix_august-04-10-1989_18_31/page/10/mode/2up?q=grebenshikov), which has the concert listings that include BG's show at Paradise Rock Club.

First, in Section 1, we have Paradise Rock Club's upcoming shows, which give us some context for what kinds of groups were playing there in 1989--note the sold out shows for [The Pixies](https://musicbrainz.org/artist/b6b2bb8d-54a9-491f-9607-7b546023b433), [The The](https://musicbrainz.org/artist/a7409219-a681-4072-adb2-5285106ce6f2), and [Hoodoo Gurus](https://musicbrainz.org/artist/ce382524-3f9b-461a-9202-60041105741c). 

This is also the only mention I've found so far that there was a support act, Hiding in Public,[^2] for BG's show at Paradise.

In Section 3, there's a big ad for _Radio Silence_ and...well, the copy here is not subtle.

The main event listings in Section 3 includes a picture of BG as the featured image.

And we can look at all of the concerts happening on 5 August 1989: what would you have been missing, if you went to see BG at Paradise? (White Zombie and Badfinger are the only names I recognize here.)

So: how did the show go?

Well, if you happen to have access to historical issues of the _Boston Globe_, there was a review published in the 7 August 1989 issue.[^3] The citation is:

Morse, Steve. 1989. "Grebenshikov Lost in the Din." _Boston Globe_, August 7, 1989.

The review is not especially positive! Morse apparently saw BG perform with Aquarium in Montreal in 1988 and makes an unfavorable comparison between the two shows, stating that the Montreal show was "a long way from the more limited commercial sound that Grebenshikov brought to the Paradise." Some more choice quotes from this interview:

> [Though] known as the poet laureate of Russian rock, he gave a concert in which his mostly American pickup band played so loudly and aggressively that his lyrics, sung in English save for the two encores, were tragically lost in the din.

> Grebenshikov, who recently cut his pony tail and looks more and more like his idol Lou Reed, had a few special moments, particularly later in the show when he loosened his stoical stage presence and finally appeared to enjoy himself. He glistened on "The Quiet One," a new, unrecorded song combining a Led Zeppelin punch with a Middle Eastern influence partly due to drummer Tal Bergman, who is from Israel.

> Perhaps Grebenshikov was wrong in leaving [Aquarium] home. It would be a bit like Bruce Springsteen making his Russian debut without the E Street Band. In effect, we've been denied the full range of Grebenshikov's talent, which is a very risky move on his part.

I'm curious to see if I can find any more reviews, but I'm not really sure where else to look. Are there other local papers that would have published concert reviews? Would someone who attended the concert have written about it and posted their recollections online years later? Do I need to go out and try to collect oral histories?

[^1]: Super excited to stumble on this, as this article predates Ryback's excellent monograph on the topic (incidentally, also available to borrow from [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/rockaroundblochi0000ryba)) by a few years and has this lovely note at the end: "For information on where to buy Soviet-bloc rock recordings send a self-addressed stamped envelope to: Timothy W. Ryback, German Department, Harvard University, Cambridge 02138"
[^2]: Went ahead and created a [MusicBrainz artist entry](https://musicbrainz.org/artist/c3ed6b69-0645-436f-9f66-96f2aabdcae8) for them; I'm assuming that [this Facebook artist page](https://www.facebook.com/hidinginpublicband) with the description "Late 80's very early 90's Boston band" is them and from some initial searching in the _Phoenix_, I can see yet another interesting little research path to follow, since you can sort of track their career through the classified ads and event listings.
[^3]: One could also search "boris grebenshikov boston 1989" and find a copy of the review of that concert from the _Boston Globe_ republished on an Aquarium fan site. But I couldn't possibly advocate the use of a copyright-violating resource.
