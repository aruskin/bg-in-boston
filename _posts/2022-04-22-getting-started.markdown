## A super brief history of BG and Aquarium[^5]

[Boris Grebenshchikov](https://musicbrainz.org/artist/2fccd72c-a3ba-4ca6-a89b-4024358c4f78)[^1] (b. 27 November 1953) is the lead singer and founding member of the Russian rock band [Aquarium](https://musicbrainz.org/artist/8d741103-d319-4cc8-9f4f-9926b5bf112a)[^2]. He started the band in 1972, when he was a student at Leningrad University. Aquarium were initially an "underground" band, performing at apartment concerts, unofficially releasing their recordings as *magnitizdat*, and experiencing various issues with the Soviet authorities.[^4] And then: *glasnost*. 

In 1988, Aquarium released the album [*Ravnodenstviye*](https://musicbrainz.org/release-group/9e0e1df9-9a34-342c-aa84-85bf2d27ffd1) on [Melodiya](https://musicbrainz.org/label/90fb1e37-35d4-4150-a4d6-4b438fbbc7a6), the official state record label, and BG signed a contract with [Columbia](https://musicbrainz.org/label/011d1192-6f65-45bd-85c4-0400dd45693e). Aquarium were given permission to tour abroad and performed at the 1988 conference of the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War in Montreal, alongside [Crosby, Stills & Nash](https://musicbrainz.org/artist/cfafad90-b736-4c74-8ded-f3f4d7b2c792), [Bruce Cockburn](https://musicbrainz.org/artist/254b70d3-4aec-4c64-ac95-b13a1dbb30cb), and [Michel Rivard](https://musicbrainz.org/artist/b6e3d861-28fd-499c-a4c1-bebbdb526bec). 

In the summer of 1989, BG was on his first US tour, promoting his English-language solo album [*Radio Silence*](https://musicbrainz.org/release-group/4da61915-c33f-3260-833f-343cca02a61e), produced by [Dave Stewart](https://musicbrainz.org/artist/183da50a-b033-408e-862b-cab1c2425cff) and recorded in North America and the UK, featuring Western musicians such as [Annie Lennox](https://musicbrainz.org/artist/3e30aebd-0557-4cfd-8fb9-3945afa5d72b), [Billy MacKenzie](https://musicbrainz.org/artist/376abe26-e7a4-4ddb-b257-d7eeed79c5ee), and [Chrissie Hynde](https://musicbrainz.org/artist/a5d79c54-81c3-4a73-af6a-ad5c143d3f21). 

## The American perception of Russian rock in 1989

BG's album release and tour were part of a small wave of Russian rock activity in the US at the time; there was apparently a perception in entertainment companies that "the Gorbachev era has made Soviet culture a hot product" and an attempt to capitalize on that.[^3] Aquarium had been one of the bands featured on the compilation album [*Red Wave: 4 Underground Bands from the Soviet Union*](https://musicbrainz.org/release-group/fc4f4eac-d716-4d95-be20-f91211b31163), released in the US in 1986 by the Australian independent record label [Big Time Records](https://musicbrainz.org/label/d6998776-9657-4c3e-86aa-a1570df1eb6b). By the summer of 1989, [Zvuki Mu](https://musicbrainz.org/artist/d88d05da-e1a3-463a-97b1-245482550dfd) had released the [Brian Eno](https://musicbrainz.org/artist/ff95eb47-41c4-4f7f-a104-cdc30f02e872)-produced album [*Zvuki Mu*](https://musicbrainz.org/release-group/59110b9b-c7c1-360a-80a3-306f399a5427) on [Warner Bros.](https://musicbrainz.org/label/c595c289-47ce-4fba-b999-b87503e8cb71) and embarked on their own US tour, Kino had released *Gruppa Krovi* on Gold Castle Records, Artemy Troitsky released his English-language history of Soviet rock, *Back in the USSR*...

## The Larry Katz interview

During this period, BG also appeared on *Late Night with David Letterman*. In his brief interview with Letterman, he's charming and a bit glib, as befits the format; in the Katz interview, he covers some of the same topics in a more thoughtful and expansive manner.


[^1]: In Russian, Борис Гребенщиков. This often gets romanized as Boris Grebenshikov in the English-language press, although it probably shouldn't (ш ≠ щ). He's also known as БГ in Russia, so I'm going to use BG going forward to avoid dealing with that and save myself some keystrokes. 
[^2]: Аквариум in Russian. I am generally pro-transliteration over translation of Russian band names, but for consistency with how they're referred to in this interview and in English-language news articles, I will go with Aquarium rather than Akvarium.
[^4]: More context about the official vs unofficial distinction...controversy at the 1980 Spring Rhythms Festival in Tbilisi, 1982 concert in Arkhangelsk "where the DK administrator refused to allow BG to go on stage barefoot"; BG did anyway and so Aquarium was banned from performing publicly and played apartment concerts for the next six months (Steinholt, p. 41)
