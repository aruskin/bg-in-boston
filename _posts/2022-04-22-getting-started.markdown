## A super brief history of BG and Aquarium[^5]

[Boris Grebenshchikov](https://musicbrainz.org/artist/2fccd72c-a3ba-4ca6-a89b-4024358c4f78)[^1] (b. 27 November 1953) is the lead singer and founding member of the Russian rock band [Aquarium](https://musicbrainz.org/artist/8d741103-d319-4cc8-9f4f-9926b5bf112a)[^2]. He started the band in 1972, when he was a student at Leningrad University. Aquarium were initially an "underground" band, performing at apartment concerts, unofficially releasing their recordings as *magnitizdat*, and experiencing various issues with the Soviet authorities.[^4] And then: *glasnost*. 

In 1988, Aquarium released the album [*Ravnodenstviye*](https://musicbrainz.org/release-group/9e0e1df9-9a34-342c-aa84-85bf2d27ffd1) on [Melodiya](https://musicbrainz.org/label/90fb1e37-35d4-4150-a4d6-4b438fbbc7a6), the official state record label, and BG signed a contract with [Columbia](https://musicbrainz.org/label/011d1192-6f65-45bd-85c4-0400dd45693e). Aquarium were given permission to tour abroad and performed at the 1988 conference of the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War in Montreal, alongside [Crosby, Stills & Nash](https://musicbrainz.org/artist/cfafad90-b736-4c74-8ded-f3f4d7b2c792), [Bruce Cockburn](https://musicbrainz.org/artist/254b70d3-4aec-4c64-ac95-b13a1dbb30cb), and [Michel Rivard](https://musicbrainz.org/artist/b6e3d861-28fd-499c-a4c1-bebbdb526bec). 

In the summer of 1989, BG was on his first US tour, promoting his English-language solo album [*Radio Silence*](https://musicbrainz.org/release-group/4da61915-c33f-3260-833f-343cca02a61e), produced by [Dave Stewart](https://musicbrainz.org/artist/183da50a-b033-408e-862b-cab1c2425cff) and recorded in North America and the UK, featuring Western musicians such as [Annie Lennox](https://musicbrainz.org/artist/3e30aebd-0557-4cfd-8fb9-3945afa5d72b), [Billy MacKenzie](https://musicbrainz.org/artist/376abe26-e7a4-4ddb-b257-d7eeed79c5ee), and [Chrissie Hynde](https://musicbrainz.org/artist/a5d79c54-81c3-4a73-af6a-ad5c143d3f21). 

## The American perception of Russian rock in 1989

BG's album release and tour were part of a small wave of Russian rock activity in the US at the time; there was apparently a perception in entertainment companies that "the Gorbachev era has made Soviet culture a hot product" and an attempt to capitalize on that.[^3] Aquarium had been one of the bands featured on the compilation album [*Red Wave: 4 Underground Bands from the Soviet Union*](https://musicbrainz.org/release-group/fc4f4eac-d716-4d95-be20-f91211b31163), released in the US in 1986 by the Australian independent record label [Big Time Records](https://musicbrainz.org/label/d6998776-9657-4c3e-86aa-a1570df1eb6b). By the summer of 1989, [Zvuki Mu](https://musicbrainz.org/artist/d88d05da-e1a3-463a-97b1-245482550dfd) had released the [Brian Eno](https://musicbrainz.org/artist/ff95eb47-41c4-4f7f-a104-cdc30f02e872)-produced album [*Zvuki Mu*](https://musicbrainz.org/release-group/59110b9b-c7c1-360a-80a3-306f399a5427) on [Warner Bros.](https://musicbrainz.org/label/c595c289-47ce-4fba-b999-b87503e8cb71) and embarked on their own US tour, Kino had released *Gruppa Krovi* on Gold Castle Records, Artemy Troitsky released his English-language history of Soviet rock, *Back in the USSR*...

## The Larry Katz interview

During this period, BG also appeared on *Late Night with David Letterman*. 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eP-RTVDhDPc?start=322" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In his brief interview with Letterman, he's charming and a bit glib, as befits the format; in the Katz interview, he covers some of the same topics (the process of recording Radio Silence, the tour, his first exposure to The Beatles on Voice of America, the commercial aspect of rock[^6]), in a more thoughtful and expansive manner. 

The Katz interview is undated, so I'm not sure which came first, but *Late Night* would have been taped in New York and BG alludes to being in New York in the weather-related small talk at the beginning of the Katz interview. 

So, a broad overview of the points of discussion in the Katz interview:
- Preliminary small talk about the weather (and the greenhouse effect?)
- BG's tour
- Other Russian rock musicians releasing albums in the US and the significance of that; BG gets into a weird religious metaphor that becomes less and less clear as he goes on, but I'd highlight this section:

    > Larry Katz:  You know, you might think [...] that along with chauvinistic feeling towards their artists, that [Russians] also might take pride in them, and that the Russian musicians would be heard outside, beyond the borders of their country, and that it would be a sign of their worth, in that it wasn't just secondhand, you know.

    > BG: I don't think they need the Western acceptance. Because, you see, it's like you have a church, and you have a priest, a group of priests, and suddenly this priest [is] being sent on a mission somewhere to Africa or whatever, and that's okay, of course, but people would rather have him back home.

- BG's personal history with rock music, from first hearing the Beatles to playing in school bands. He talks about transitioning from singing English-language covers to playing original material in Russian.[^7]
- The legality of playing rock music in the Soviet Union--what you would and wouldn't get arrested for
- Aquarium's place in the Russian rock scene
- The commercial rock that's currently flourishing under Gorbachev[^9]
    > BG: [...] everybody in Russia is making money right now. That's why I split--that's why I couldn't stand it. And I decided to spend some time here, just to be away from the scene when everybody's just making money and nothing else.
- American musicians going over and playing concerts in Russia (BG has some things to say about Bon Jovi!)
    > BG: Well, not a lot of people in the West seem to understand that when, for example, when Billy Joel came along or Elton John or people like this...Well, I've heard a lot of big stories about that, about the way kids were rioting, [...] and it was really interesting and fun. But all those kids who were rioting in the audience, they were listening to their Led Zeppelin albums for 20 years. Billy Joel is no eye opener. All these guys they know rock and roll backwards. They've been through the homework.

- How to acquire records on the black market
- What is unique about Russian rock - again, we talk about commercialism (or lack thereof)
    > LK: So in a way you could say that Russian rock musicians [...] will help remind US and other rock musicians around the world [of] the original spirit that motivated rock and roll in the first place?

    > BG: I would say yes, though in Russia it's much more evident than it was ever evident here, because here, it was always connected with money and in Russia, [...] it had no connection with money whatsoever for a long, long, long time. Only now people are discovering that rock and roll can bring money. Before rock and roll could have brought only misfortune and harassment. Bad things in general.
- The records BG has been excited to find in the US[^8]
- Working with Dave Stewart and [the documentary Michael Apted directed](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097774/) about the recording process for *Radio Silence*

[^1]: In Russian, Борис Гребенщиков. This often gets romanized as Boris Grebenshikov in the English-language press, although it probably shouldn't (ш ≠ щ). He's also known as БГ in Russia, so I'm going to use BG going forward to avoid dealing with that and save myself some keystrokes. 
[^2]: Аквариум in Russian. I am generally pro-transliteration over translation of Russian band names, but for consistency with how they're referred to in this interview and in English-language news articles, I will go with Aquarium rather than Akvarium.
[^4]: More context about the official vs unofficial distinction...controversy at the 1980 Spring Rhythms Festival in Tbilisi, 1982 concert in Arkhangelsk "where the DK administrator refused to allow BG to go on stage barefoot"; BG did anyway and so Aquarium was banned from performing publicly and played apartment concerts for the next six months (Steinholt, p. 41)

[^6]: A great exchange:
    > David Letterman: Are you making a lot of money doing this?

    > Boris Grebenshchikov: Nuh-uh.

    > DL: Does that trouble you? Because, as you know, here in the United States and other places, rock and roll people who are successful make huge sums of money?

    > BG: Isn't it why rock and roll here is so boring?

[^7]: This big switch from English to Russian was a key aspect in the development of Russian rock, and I think is especially interesting given the same thing sort of happening again in the 2010s Russian indie scene.

Not totally surprising, given Aquarium's music (they've had an [actual Irish flautist](https://musicbrainz.org/artist/4191db60-f1ed-4676-a13d-0dfbb703e80c) in their line-up for the past decade or so), but still.
